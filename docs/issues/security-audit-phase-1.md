# Security Audit & Foundation Setup

## Summary

Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the current Libr√°n Voice Forge implementation and establish the foundational security infrastructure including HTTPS configuration and security headers.

## Value

- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identify and document current security gaps and potential attack vectors
- **HTTPS Foundation**: Establish secure communication channels for all user interactions
- **Security Headers**: Implement defense-in-depth with comprehensive security headers
- **Production Readiness**: Ensure the application meets security standards for production deployment
- **OAuth Prerequisites**: Create the secure foundation required for OAuth implementation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Security Audit
- [ ] Review current authentication mechanisms for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Audit API endpoints for proper input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Check for information disclosure in error messages and logs
- [ ] Verify rate limiting implementation effectiveness
- [ ] Assess session management security (if any)
- [ ] Review environment variable handling and secret management
- [ ] Check for CSRF, XSS, and injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Audit file upload and processing security
- [ ] Review CORS configuration and origin validation
- [ ] Document security findings and remediation plan

### HTTPS Configuration
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS certificates for production (Vercel)
- [ ] Set up local HTTPS development environment
- [ ] Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirects
- [ ] Configure HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers
- [ ] Ensure all API endpoints are HTTPS-only
- [ ] Verify mixed content prevention
- [ ] Test HTTPS functionality across all browsers

### Security Headers
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Add X-Frame-Options header
- [ ] Configure X-Content-Type-Options
- [ ] Set X-XSS-Protection header
- [ ] Add Referrer-Policy header
- [ ] Implement Permissions-Policy header
- [ ] Configure Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- [ ] Add Cache-Control headers for sensitive content

### Development & Testing
- [ ] Create local HTTPS development setup
- [ ] Test security headers with online tools
- [ ] Verify HTTPS redirect functionality
- [ ] Test API endpoints over HTTPS
- [ ] Validate certificate chain and configuration

## Technical Implementation

### Security Audit Checklist
1. **Authentication Review**
   - Current X-Admin-Secret and X-API-Secret implementation
   - Rate limiting bypass vulnerabilities
   - Session management (currently none)

2. **API Security Review**
   - Input validation in `/api/translate` and `/api/speak`
   - Error handling and information disclosure
   - CORS configuration review

3. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Environment variable security
   - Log file security and sensitive data exposure
   - File system access controls

### HTTPS Setup
1. **Production (Vercel)**
   - Verify automatic HTTPS configuration
   - Test certificate validity and renewal
   - Configure custom domain HTTPS

2. **Development Environment**
   - Set up local SSL certificates
   - Configure Next.js for HTTPS development
   - Update development scripts

### Security Headers Implementation
```typescript
// Example security headers configuration
const securityHeaders = [
  {
    key: 'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control',
    value: 'on'
  },
  {
    key: 'X-XSS-Protection',
    value: '1; mode=block'
  },
  {
    key: 'X-Frame-Options',
    value: 'SAMEORIGIN'
  },
  {
    key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
    value: 'nosniff'
  },
  {
    key: 'Referrer-Policy',
    value: 'origin-when-cross-origin'
  }
]
```

## Dependencies

- No new dependencies required
- Uses existing Next.js configuration
- Leverages Vercel's built-in HTTPS support

## Testing

- [ ] Security audit using automated tools
- [ ] Manual penetration testing of key endpoints
- [ ] HTTPS configuration testing
- [ ] Security headers validation
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities identified
- [ ] All traffic redirected to HTTPS
- [ ] Security headers score A+ on securityheaders.com
- [ ] Local development environment supports HTTPS
- [ ] All API endpoints accessible only via HTTPS

## Notes

- This is Phase 1 of the security suite implementation
- Foundation for OAuth implementation in Phase 2
- Critical for production deployment readiness
- Builds upon existing universal security middleware
