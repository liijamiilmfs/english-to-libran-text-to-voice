# Test Quality Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the comprehensive test quality standards and processes implemented in the Libr√°n Voice Forge project to ensure reliable, maintainable, and high-coverage testing.

## Coverage Standards

### Global Thresholds
- **Statements**: 90%
- **Branches**: 85%
- **Functions**: 90%
- **Lines**: 90%

### Module-Specific Thresholds
- **lib/**: 95% (core library code)
- **app/api/**: 90% (API endpoints)
- **app/components/**: 85% (UI components)
- **test/**: 80% (test utilities)

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests
- **Location**: `test/unit/`
- **Purpose**: Test individual functions and classes in isolation
- **Coverage**: All critical business logic
- **Examples**: TTS cache, voice filters, rule engine, object URL manager

### Integration Tests
- **Location**: `test/integration/`
- **Purpose**: Test component interactions and API endpoints
- **Coverage**: End-to-end workflows and system integration
- **Examples**: TTS route, security authentication, translator pipeline

### Python Tests
- **Location**: `test/python/`
- **Purpose**: Test Python utilities and data processing
- **Coverage**: Dictionary importer and validation logic
- **Framework**: Pytest

## Test Quality Standards

### 1. Test Isolation
- Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests
- Use proper setup and teardown methods
- Mock external dependencies consistently

### 2. Deterministic Tests
- Tests should produce the same results every time
- Avoid random data or time-dependent logic
- Use fixed test data and controlled environments

### 3. Clear Test Names
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow the pattern: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks

### 4. Comprehensive Coverage
- Test happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions
- Include boundary value testing
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### 5. Performance Considerations
- Tests should complete within reasonable time limits
- Use appropriate timeouts for async operations
- Avoid unnecessary delays or long-running operations

## Flaky Test Prevention

### Common Causes of Flaky Tests
1. **Race Conditions**: Tests that depend on timing
2. **Shared State**: Tests that modify global state
3. **External Dependencies**: Tests that rely on network or file system
4. **Random Data**: Tests using unpredictable input
5. **Async Operations**: Improper handling of promises and callbacks

### Prevention Strategies
1. **Proper Mocking**: Mock all external dependencies
2. **Test Isolation**: Ensure tests don't affect each other
3. **Deterministic Data**: Use fixed test data
4. **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement retry logic for flaky operations
5. **Time Control**: Mock time-dependent operations

### Detection Tools
- **Flaky Test Detector**: Automated detection of flaky tests
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Built-in retry for potentially flaky tests
- **CI Monitoring**: Track test stability over time

## Test Execution

### Local Development
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npx vitest test/unit/tts-cache.test.ts

# Watch mode
npm run test:coverage:watch
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automated Testing**: All tests run on every PR
- **Coverage Gates**: PRs must meet coverage thresholds
- **Flaky Test Detection**: Regular detection of unstable tests
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track test execution times

### Coverage Reporting
- **HTML Reports**: Detailed coverage reports in `coverage/` directory
- **LCOV Format**: Compatible with Codecov and other tools
- **PR Comments**: Automatic coverage updates on pull requests

## Test Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Review Coverage Reports**: Ensure thresholds are maintained
2. **Detect Flaky Tests**: Run flaky test detection regularly
3. **Update Test Data**: Keep test data current and relevant
4. **Refactor Tests**: Improve test quality and maintainability

### When Adding New Features
1. **Write Tests First**: Follow TDD practices when possible
2. **Update Coverage**: Ensure new code meets coverage thresholds
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Include boundary and error condition testing
4. **Update Documentation**: Keep test documentation current

### When Fixing Bugs
1. **Write Regression Tests**: Prevent bugs from reoccurring
2. **Test the Fix**: Ensure the fix works as expected
3. **Update Related Tests**: Modify affected test cases
4. **Verify Coverage**: Maintain coverage standards

## Best Practices

### Test Organization
- Group related tests in `describe` blocks
- Use clear, descriptive test names
- Organize tests by functionality, not by file structure
- Keep test files focused and manageable

### Test Data Management
- Use factories or builders for test data creation
- Keep test data minimal and focused
- Avoid hardcoded values when possible
- Use constants for repeated test data

### Error Testing
- Test all error conditions and edge cases
- Verify error messages and codes
- Test error handling and recovery
- Include timeout and failure scenarios

### Performance Testing
- Include performance tests for critical paths
- Monitor test execution times
- Use appropriate timeouts
- Test with realistic data volumes

## Tools and Utilities

### Test Utilities
- **Flaky Test Detector**: `test/utils/flaky-test-detector.ts`
- **Test Setup**: `test/setup.ts`
- **Mock Utilities**: Built-in mocking helpers

### Coverage Tools
- **Vitest Coverage**: Built-in coverage reporting
- **Coverage Reports**: `scripts/coverage-report.js`
- **Threshold Checking**: Automated threshold validation

### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated test execution
- **Codecov**: Coverage reporting and tracking
- **PR Comments**: Automatic coverage updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Low Coverage**: Add tests for uncovered code paths
2. **Flaky Tests**: Identify and fix race conditions
3. **Slow Tests**: Optimize test performance
4. **Test Failures**: Debug and fix failing tests

### Debugging Tips
1. **Use Debug Mode**: Run tests with verbose output
2. **Isolate Tests**: Run individual tests to identify issues
3. **Check Mocks**: Verify mock configurations
4. **Review Logs**: Check test execution logs for errors

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics to Track
- **Coverage Percentage**: Overall and per-module coverage
- **Test Execution Time**: Performance of test suite
- **Flaky Test Rate**: Percentage of unstable tests
- **Test Maintenance Cost**: Time spent on test maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly Coverage Review**: Ensure standards are maintained
- **Quarterly Test Quality Review**: Assess overall test quality
- **Annual Test Strategy Review**: Update testing approach

### Feedback Loop
- **Developer Feedback**: Collect input on test quality
- **CI/CD Metrics**: Monitor test pipeline performance
- **Coverage Trends**: Track coverage changes over time
